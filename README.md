# node-express-babel-boilerplate

This application is a kick-starting with simple node js application (**Server Side**) 
that allows you to use `import` statement and other es6 experimental features.


# Installation

Just clone the repository then run one of the following:

`yarn install`

OR 

`npm install`


# Starting the server 

After installation is completed, start the server by running the following command:

`yarn serve`

OR 

`npm run serve`


# Production

As node js does not fully support all es6, we can build the application to be compatible with node js in production.

Run the following command for building the application:

`yarn build`

OR 

`npm run build`

This will create `dist` directory with the build files, you can use that directory in your online server.
