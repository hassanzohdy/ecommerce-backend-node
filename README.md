# Ecommerce Node Js Application

This is an ecommerce application backend built with node js with fully organized structure.


# Installation

Just clone the repository then run one of the following:

`yarn install`

OR 

`npm install`

# Starting the server 

After installation is completed, start the server by running the following command:

`yarn serve`

OR 

`npm run serve`


# Production

As node js does not fully support all es6, we can build the application to be compatible with node js in production.

Run the following command for building the application:

`yarn build`

OR 

`npm run build`

This will create `dist` directory with the build files, you can use that directory in your online server.
